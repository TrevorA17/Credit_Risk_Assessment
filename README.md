# Credit Risk Assessment
This project aims to develop a predictive model for assessing credit risk using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing various attributes of loan applicants, such as age, income, employment status, loan amount, and credit history. I employed a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) algorithm to build the predictive model due to its robust performance in handling complex relationships within the data. The trained model can predict the likelihood of default on a loan application, providing valuable insights to lenders for making informed decisions on credit approvals. Additionally, I have implemented a RESTful API using Plumber in R, allowing users to interact with the model and make real-time predictions based on input parameters. This project aims to streamline the credit risk assessment process and contribute to more accurate lending practices. I welcome contributions and feedback to further enhance the model's performance and usability.
